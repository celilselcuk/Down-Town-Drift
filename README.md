<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :book: Overview</h2>

Down Town Drift is a game that has been designed in the endless runner genre of games. For those of you who don't know, this style involves the player dodging obstacles that approach them rapidly, and to survive as long as possible while collecting bonuses along the way. Famous examples include Temple Run and Subway Surfers.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :mag: About The Project</h2>

In this game, the player can drive up and down to avoid incoming hazards and pick up coins to use in the avatar. There is a tutorial outlining everything. The project is entirely built using the Pygame library and Python and thus has limited graphics, relying mainly on pixel art.
